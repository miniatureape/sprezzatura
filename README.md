#### Sprezzatura

So much information about the writing proccess is lost in the end product.

This is a little visualization that attempts to put some of it back in. As you type, the color of the text area will change. A text written freely, without edits, will appear green, while one where the writer has deleted and rewrote will appear more red.

The hope is that in a glance one can tell something about the process.
